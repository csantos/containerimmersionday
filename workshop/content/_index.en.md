<!-- Running containers in the AWS Cloud allows you to build robust, scalable applications and services. This workshop will cover running containers using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) both with EC2 Spot and AWS Fargate deployment methods. Throughout this workshop, our container experts will discuss how to get started with AWS container services and host hands-on labs covering what you need to know to begin building modern applications using containers in the cloud. -->
