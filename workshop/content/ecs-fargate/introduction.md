Mythical Mysfits is a (fictional) pet adoption non-profit dedicated to helping abandoned, and often misunderstood, mythical creatures find a new forever family! Mythical Mysfits believes that all creatures deserve a second chance, even if they spent their first chance hiding under bridges and unapologetically robbing helpless travelers.

Our business has been thriving with only a single Mysfits adoption center, located inside Devils Tower National Monument. Speak, friend, and enter should you ever come to visit.

We've just had a surge of new mysfits arrive at our door with nowhere else to go! They're all pretty distraught after not only being driven from their homes... but an immensely grumpy ogre has also denied them all entry at a swamp they've used for refuge in the past.

That's why we've hired you to be our first Full Stack Engineer. We need a more scalable way to show off our inventory of mysfits and let families adopt them. We'd like you to build the first Mythical Mysfits adoption website to help introduce these lovable, magical, often mischievous creatures to the world!
