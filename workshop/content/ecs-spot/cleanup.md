## Workshop Cleanup

This section will appear again below as a reminder because you will be deploying infrastructure on AWS which will have an associated cost. Fortunately, this workshop should take no more than 2 hours to complete, so costs will be minimal. See the appendix for an estimate of what this workshop should cost to run. When you're done with the workshop, follow these steps to make sure everything is cleaned up.

1. Delete any manually created resources throughout the labs.
1. Delete any data files stored on S3 and container images stored in ECR.
1. Delete the CloudFormation stack launched at the beginning of the workshop.
