## Conventions

Throughout this README, we provide commands for you to run in the terminal. These commands will look like this:

```bash
$ ssh -i PRIVATE_KEY.PEM ec2-user@EC2_PUBLIC_DNS_NAME
```

The command starts after $. Words that are **UPPER_ITALIC_BOLD** indicate a value that is unique to your environment. For example, the **PRIVATE_KEY.PEM** refers to the private key of an SSH key pair that you've created, and the **EC2_PUBLIC_DNS_NAME** is a value that is specific to an EC2 instance launched in your account.
