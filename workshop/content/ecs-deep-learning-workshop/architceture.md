## Your Challenge 

There are just not enough [cat pictures on social media](http://mashable.com/category/cats/) these days, to the point where it would be amazing to have a social network dedicated to devoted cat lovers around the world. The problem is, how do you make sure images uploaded to this niche network are cat related? Image classification to the rescue!

Implement MXNet to recognize a variety of images, so you can specifically identify ones of our favorite feline friend!

Here is the overall architecture of what you will be building throughout this workshop. By the end of the workshop, you will have the ability to interact directly with the MXNet containers using SSH or [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html). You will also have the option to create [Tasks in ECS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduling_tasks.html) which can be run through the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), [CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) or [SDKs](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk).
